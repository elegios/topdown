# General Description #
=======================
- Server and client communicates by sending specially formatted JSON over websockets.
- The game plays in "ticks", where the amount of actions per tick is limited per character.
- The server may decide whether actions are carried out immediately or after a call to "tick".
- The server only responds with <tick-update>, one response per server tick, and <item>, one per "itemrequest".
- Upon connecting the server will send one tick-update.
- Moving into a character or other colliding object might be an attack, it might activate something
(e.g. press a button), it might initiate conversation, or it might simply fail. It will consume an action regardless.
